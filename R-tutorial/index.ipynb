In this tutorial, we will use the [statistical programming language R](https://www.r-project.org/) to access EMODnet map images, data and metadata.\n\nThe EMODnet data portals allow web acces to map images, data and metadata through [Open Geospatial Consortium Web Services](https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/owc). This is a set of standards which allow to transfer geospatial data and metadata over the web. We will show following services available from EMODnet:\n\n* [Web Map Service (WMS)](https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms): Allows you to download geo-referenced map images\n\n* [Web Feature Service (WFS)](https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs): Allows you to download geospatial vector data\n\n* [Web Coverage Service (WCS)](https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcs): Allows you to download geospatial raster data\n\n* [Catalogue Service for the Web (CSW)](https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/cat): Allows you to search the catalogue of metadata to find the dataset you are looking for.\n\nThe full list of URL's you need to access the [web service doucmentation repository on GitHub](https://github.com/EMODnet/Web-Service-Documentation). The exercises below cover some specific examples of how to acces and search for the data you require for your applications. You are free to use and modify this code in your own work.","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"wPvL7oBHxQnO"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The tutorial exists of two parts:\n* [Part 1](./EMODnet_web_services_in_R_part1.ipynb) covers interacting with web services from EMODnet Bathymetry, Human Activities, Physics, Seabed Habitats and Geology.\n* [Part 2](./EMODnet_web_services_in_R_part2.ipynb) covers interacting with web services from EMODnet Biology and the EMODnet Central Portal catalogue service.","metadata":{}}]}
